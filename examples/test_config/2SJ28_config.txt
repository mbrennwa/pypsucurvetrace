# Idle conditions for pre-heat and idle between readings are configured to fixed values (PSU2 output will be regulated to attain these values, see below):

# - Idle voltage (will be set as voltage limit at PSU-1 during idling):
VIDLE  = 25

#   (no min. or max. idle voltage is specified, which tells the program to use a fixed V1 idle voltage)

# - Idle current is (the target value to be attained with PSU-2 regulation)
