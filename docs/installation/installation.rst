Prerequisites

The installation procedures described below used the Python package manager ``pipx``. Depending on your installation method (see below), you may also need ``git``:

   * To install these tools on Debian, Ubuntu or similar Linux distros, just run the following command:

      .. code-block:: console
   
         sudo apt install pipx git
      
   * On other Linux distros, Windows, or macOS, use the respective software installer channels or follow the instructions `here <http://pypa.github.io/pipx>`_  (for ``pipx``) and `here <http://git-scm.com/>`_ (for ``git``).
   
``pypsucurvetrace`` needs access to the serial ports of your PSUs. Make sure your user account has the required access permissions:

   * On Linux, add your username to the ``dialout`` group. If your user account is ``johndoe``, execute the following command:

      .. code-block:: console

         sudo adduser johndoe dialout
         
     Then reboot the computer for this to take effect.
