The |cconvert| program converts data files from other curve tracers to |pypsucurvetrace| format. This allows using these data with the |pypsucurvetrace| tools.

Running |cconvert|
----------------------
The |cconvert| program is invoked from the command line. Full documentation is not yet available in this document, but can be accessed from the |curvetrace| program directly:

.. code-block:: console

   cconvert --help
